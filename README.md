# pivid-flask
A simple web server which allows file browsing and playing videos
It is recommended to run it on a raspberry pi which will alwais be on/connected to the internet(preferabley on ethernet), but will work on any system that supports flask

#SETUP
##1
install the main.py script
##2
make a usb folder, then make subfolders with any name and mount the drives you want to have access to those subfolders

##3
pip3 install flask
run py file as sudo

#GG
any issues? well, you will have to figure it out yourself.. I still don't have a discord server, maybe I will some day, but there will be a video, like an announcement if I forget to edit this file
